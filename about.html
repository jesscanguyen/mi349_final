    <h2>hey! i'm jessica ٩(^ᗜ^ )و ´-</h2>
        <p>welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <h3>my background</h3>
            <p>i am a senior at michigan state university working towards a BFA in information science (concentration in human-centered design) with a minor in graphic design. growing up, i always had a passion for design, psychology, and the humanities. i wanted to be able to help the people around me and improve their lives. UX design allows me to combine all of them together in a fulfilling manner to create solutions that ideally both help and brighten people's days!</p>
        <h3>my motivation</h3>
            <p>i want to contribute my design, personal experiences, and accessibility knowledge to projects that make a meaningful and memorable impact on users' lives; especially if that means putting a smile on their faces. by integrating thoughtful design and user research, i aim to create solutions with design that are not only visually engaging, but accessible, inclusive, and human-centered.</p>
        <h3>what i'm working on</h3>
            <p>currently, i am a student accessibility employee for the msu libraries, ensuring the online educational resources are accessible for all by checking compatibility with screen readers, assistive technology, keyboard functionality, etc.</p>
            <p>most recently, i worked with a student start-up as their temporary UI/UX designer to ensure their website and features are more approachable and user-friendly in preparation for their official launch, creating and sharing low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes with the developers, conducting user research, and conducting competitive analysis.</p>
